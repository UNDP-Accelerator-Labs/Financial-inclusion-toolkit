## About designing an innovation policy

An innovation policy or strategy is a formal document outlining a governmentâ€™s stance towards innovation, its values, objectives and indicators of success. It can have substantial impact in orienting the expectations of all actors in the ecosystem: for example, if the policy insists on using innovation to bring about digital inclusion, private sector companies and nonprofits alike will learn this is a national priority, and work in this direction will be followed with interest by the government.
