# An innovative approach to Financial Literacy for Women Entrepreneurs

The UNDP Mauritius and Seychelles Accelerator Lab, in partnership with the University of Mauritius and other local stakeholders, including the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family Welfare, the National Women Entrepreneur Council, and Small and Medium Enterprise Mauritius (SME Mauritius), conducted an experiment with 30 women entrepreneurs from the Republic of Mauritius.

**What it does:** The experiment was to evaluate the effect of an online solution on women's financial literacy. The training content, which was developed in _'Kreol Morisien'_ in video format, was used to train women-led entrepreneurs with suffering businesses who lacked financial literacy.

 Multiple methods, such as surveys, interviews and focus groups, were used to understand what aspects of entrepreneurial finance were most difficult or confusing for women entrepreneurs to understand via traditional class-type training. Then, the course content and delivery were tailored to address those issues and provide clear and relevant examples and exercises and the interaction.

 A baseline study of the cohort's capacity was undertaken to obtain a comparative analysis, showcasing improvements, and equating them to the success of micro and small enterprises.

The experiment aimed to:

1. **Design:** An online solution, including YouTube videos in the local language, specifically in Mauritian Creole. This solution was tested to determine if it could efficiently enhance financial literacy for the pilot group of women entrepreneurs participating in the experiment.
2. **Monitor** : The perceived knowledge and understanding in the following key financial management practices, through a pre-test and post-test with the entrepreneurs, included:

1. _Understanding the Business Life Cycle_
2. _Understanding Basic Financial Statements_
3. _Budgeting_
4. _Working Capital Management_
5. _Sources of Finance_
6. _Costing a product and services_

1. **Experiment with** : Online peer-to-peer interactive platforms, specifically WhatsApp â€“ a popular app used by most entrepreneurs on the islands within the Republic, for sharing of challenges and learnings, networking and also increasing the confidence of the participating entrepreneurs. More specifically, the experiment aimed to evaluate the impact of peer-to-peer communication on financial understanding and motivation. WhatsApp allowed the participants to share their experiences, challenges, and feedback with each other in a convenient and familiar way.

**Value proposition:** This simple, yet innovative approach aims to create an online financial literacy platform for women entrepreneurs. It seeks to support women-led micro and small enterprises in improving their financial resilience, operational capacity, and develop resilient business models. By using this approach, micro and small sized entrepreneurs can learn at their own pace and convenience, without affecting their daily activities. This initiative aligns with the UNDP's Signature Solutions focused on addressing Poverty and Inequality as well as Gender Equality and can help achieve the key targeted SDGs 1, 5, 8 and 10.

**Why and when to use it:** The tool is most useful when the participants use the tool (videos) for learning when they are free (more flexible) from other entrepreneurial obligations, are motivated to exchange across the online platform and learn from challenges experienced, and also are able to apply learnings to their everyday activities.

**Known issues and troubleshooting:** While there are no known issues with the experiment, all risks were carefully monitored throughout. Emphasis was placed on conducting the experiment in a structured manner by the team. This entailed conducting a baseline test to evaluate the current level of financial literacy level and comparing the results post-learning. However, it was tested on a small group of thirty women entrepreneurs. If scaled up, a proper risk management and monitoring mechanism will be essential.

**Context:** In 2022, the UNDP Mauritius and Seychelles Accelerator Lab facilitated a collective intelligence exercise with women entrepreneurs from MSMEs in Mauritius and Rodrigues. The group included participants from multiple sectors, notably from the tourism sector, affected by two successive COVID-related lockdowns. A key concern for the entrepreneurs was the limited financial literacy for them, which led to difficulties in filling out important documents like financial returns and VAT for the local revenue authority. It increased their operational costs and exacerbated the difficulties they already encountered in accessing affordable capital through the formal financial systems.

**Cost:** The Accelerator Lab secured partnerships successfully. This initiative was funded by the UNDP Accelerator Lab and co-designed with the local academic institution for approximately MUR 780,000 (USD 17,300). The SME Mauritius and the National Women Entrepreneur Council collaborated by making this initiative accessible to women entrepreneurs from Mauritius and Rodrigues for the pilot experiment. With collaboration for scaling up with the ministry and other institutions, costs could be reduced as the content and design are available, although some small adjustments might be required to update the content, among others.

**People:** Funded and co-designed by the UNDP Accelerator Lab Mauritius & Seychelles team, in collaboration with the external consultant University of Mauritius, and with the support of partners and collaboratorsincluding the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family Welfare, National Women Entrepreneur Council, Small and Medium Enterprise Mauritius.

For colleagues who seek to replicate the experiment, the following roles are needed:

| **No.** | **Role** | **Required Skills** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Social Scientist/ Ethnographer/ Community Person | The social scientist should have the following skills: cultural awareness, observation, interviewing (fluent in local language), ethnographic writing and reflexivity of the group. S/he should be proficient in various ethnographic methods such as participant observation, taking field notes, and thematic analysis, etc. S/he should be able to design the research questions, test hypotheses, use methods and instruments for conducting the experiment, as well as analyze the data and interpret the results in a scientific way. (Other important indirect skills include empathy, curiosity, strong ethics, etc.) |
| 2 | Finance Experts and Instructor/ Trainer | A team of finance experts and instructor are also necessary. Their skills should include financial literacy, accounting, budgeting, forecasting, investing for entrepreneurial activities (aligned with the experiment's content and entrepreneurs' requirements as determined by the survey). The instructor/ trainer should be able to teach a group of entrepreneurs with a basic level of understanding. Other skills for the instructor should include good communication, local language fluency, and having a pedagogical approach to instructing the target group. |
| 3 | Videographer | The videographer should be proficient in editing, production, animation, graphics, sound design and storytelling, as well as editing software and platforms. Additionally, a videographer should exhibit local language fluency, creativity, attention to detail, the ability to incorporate feedback from the target group, and time management. (The instructional videos are very short to match the attention span of the target group.) |
| 4 | Project Coordinator | A project coordinator is essential for the experiment to be successful as there are many activities to coordinate simultaneously. Skills include experience in project management and implementation, excellent communication and the ability to inspire collaboration among the team members and stakeholders. Finally, local language fluency, as well as monitoring and evaluation and risk management skills are also required. |
