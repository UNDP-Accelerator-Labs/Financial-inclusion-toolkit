# How to Create a GitHub Account

## Step 1: Visit the GitHub website
Go to the [GitHub website](https://github.com/).

## Step 2: Click on 'Sign up'
On the GitHub homepage, you'll find a 'Sign up' button at the top right corner. Click on it.

## Step 3: Enter your details
You'll be redirected to the 'Join GitHub' page. Here, you'll need to enter your details:
- **Email**: Enter a valid email address. You'll need this to verify your account and to receive notifications.
- **Password**: Choose a strong password.
- **Username**: Choose a unique username. This will be part of the URL for your personal GitHub homepage.


## Step 4: Complete the setup
After entering your details, you'll need to complete a quick puzzle to verify that you're not a robot. Once you've done that, click on the 'Create account' button.

## Step 5: Verify your email address
GitHub will send a verification email to the email address you provided. Open the email and click on the verification link to verify your account.

## Step 6: Personalize your experience
After verifying your email, you'll be redirected back to GitHub where you can personalize your experience. You can choose whether you want to receive updates about certain topics, and you can choose a subscription plan. If you're just starting out, the free plan is a great choice.

## Step 7: Start exploring
Once you've completed the setup, you'll be taken to your GitHub dashboard. From here, you can start exploring repositories, creating your own projects, and collaborating with other developers.
