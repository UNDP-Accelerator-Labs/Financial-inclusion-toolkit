# How to Create a Toolkit

This guide provides a step-by-step process on how to create a toolkit using a repository.

## Step 1: Decide on the Method

There are two ways to create a toolkit:

1. **Request a Repository**: [Submit a request](https://github.com/UNDP-Accelerator-Labs/toolkit-micro-site-template/issues/new?assignees=this-pama%2Cmyjyby&labels=new+toolkit&projects=&template=feature_request.yml&title=%5BNEW+TOOLKIT%5D%3A+) to the global team to create a repository for a toolkit. This allows the global data team to provide full support for any bug fixes, issue resolutions, and updates to the toolkit. The toolkit will be created within the UNDP Acclab organization account. This method is particularly important if you plan to request a custom domain for your toolkit from the global team in the future.

2. **Fork or Clone the Repository**: You can create a copy of this repository in your personal account by forking or cloning it. To do this, click on the 'Fork' button at the top right corner of the [toolkit page](https://github.com/UNDP-Accelerator-Labs/toolkit-micro-site-template).

## Step 2: Request a Repository

If you choose the first method, you'll need to [submit a request](https://github.com/UNDP-Accelerator-Labs/toolkit-micro-site-template/issues/new?assignees=this-pama%2Cmyjyby&labels=new+toolkit&projects=&template=feature_request.yml&title=%5BNEW+TOOLKIT%5D%3A+) to the global team. Be sure to include all the necessary details about your toolkit, such as its purpose, features, and any specific requirements you may have.

## Step 3: Fork or Clone the Repository

If you choose the second method, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the [main page](https://github.com/UNDP-Accelerator-Labs/toolkit-micro-site-template) of the repository.
2. Click the 'Fork' button at the top right of the page. This will create a copy of the repository in your account.
3. If you prefer to clone the repository, click the 'Code' button, then copy the URL provided. Open your terminal, navigate to the directory where you want the repository to be, and type `git clone [URL]`. Replace `[URL]` with the URL you copied.

Remember, whether you request a repository or fork/clone it yourself, you'll need to regularly update your toolkit to incorporate any changes or improvements made to the original repository. This will ensure your toolkit remains up-to-date and continues to benefit from the ongoing support and development provided by the global team.

Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š
