# Factsheet

## Talking points to argue for the engagement of governments to support their national innovation ecosystem, and to argue for UNDP to encourage its government partners in this sense

**What it does.** Makes a case for getting involved in supporting innovation ecosystems.

**Value proposition.** By making a clear, evidence-supported argument for supporting innovation ecosystems, you will enable UNDP and government officials to make an informed decision on whether to support their national innovation ecosystem.

**Why and when to use it**. There are two use cases. The first one: when you wish to enlist the support of senior UNDP officials. The second one: when you wish to enlist the support of government officials. You can think of it as a pitch, to be delivered in a meeting or in a carefully crafted email, that opens a conversation.

**Known issues and troubleshooting**. Risks are low, the worst that can happen is that you get turned down.

**Context**. The Global Team in the UNDP Accelerator Labs produced these talking points on the basis of a survey conducted in the summer of 2022, to which 84 Labs in as many Country Offices responded. A longer write-up about the results of the survey is available in this toolkit.

**Cost to implement** (in USD): zero

**Time** (in calendar time): negligible.

**People** (team numerosity): 1

**Focal point**. Alberto Cottica and Eduardo Gustale

**Country and year**. Global Team, 2023

**Resources**.
