# The Analog to Digital Sanduk blueprint on Financial Inclusion; method to digitizing community savings processes

Lack of formal banks and financial profiles exclude rural communities from accessing affordable capital to grow
businesses. Leaving these communities with limited options and vulnerable to predatory loans with monthly
interest as high as 30â€“40%. The model explores innovative ways of addressing these socio-economic challenges faced by cross-border and local community savings. And the theory of change is that through the digitalization of the Sanduk, the groups would gain a digital financial profile that would allow them to better solicit loans from financial service providers. 


# What it does 
This process will help capture the user requirements of an analog community savings model to enable its digitalization.

# Value proposition for the government/other partner.
This process will enable any entity that seeks to improve the operational efficiency and safety of analogue group savings group processes to digitize them and provide records of financial transactions that banks and other formal institutions can use to extend financial services.
Additionally, a private sector partner can use this process as a form of R&D to develop a product from which they can offer financial services to serve the left-behind rural communities.
Partners such as civil society organizations may utilize the training component to empower more women in informal business with basic business and digital literacy skills.

mSanduk; is community savings model that adds value because:

The model provides a blueprint for the digitization of traditional financial systems in Africa and beyond and highlights the potential of innovation and technology to enhance financial inclusion and promote economic development.
By digitizing traditional financial services such as the sanduk, communities can gain access to the financial tools they need to improve their livelihoods and build a better future for themselves and their families.
Community savings groups can track transactions and savings to build a financial profile for seeking bank loans.
It makes cash available for community members to borrow during emergencies. The digital sanduk system allowed members to save and borrow money with ease, using their mobile
At border/remote areas, making payments is often a struggle, banks are inaccessible, and access to finance and financial services is nonexistent.
To safeguard money from wildfires in rural settings, where most markets are temporary structures which are de-risked by community funds being kept in sanduks,
community saw relief when they realized they could keep money on their phones and move freely without worrying about money theft/insecurity.

# Why and when to use it.

To overcome the challenges faced by the sanduks, more training and education on digital platforms and financial services are necessary. Additionally, addressing the lack of banking infrastructure and documentation issues will help Sanduks transact more efficiently.

Increasing access to digital financial services will facilitate business growth and increase financial inclusion. The successful transformation of the sanduks in the experiment provides opportunities for scaling and replication in other borderland communities across Africa. There are a couple of requirements to have in place before taking up replicating the model, and these conditions are:

The ubiquity of mobile money makes it a good tool.
The enabling environment of innovation, specifically policy, legislation and practices. 
Communities pooled savings groups in existence
Where community savings have formal structuring
Private sector entities to provide mobile money services
There is a need to work with the private sector to ensure the continuity of the initiative in its sustainability aspect.
Improved contextual information, specifically on the level of infrastructural support, physical and digital security, logistics, socio-political contexts,and how these enablers will facilitate the digital technology or otherwise,
Known issues and troubleshooting: the requirements for this tool to be used so that the user knows when not to use it will include

If there is a lack of

infrastructure: mobile network access; the tech infrastructure is necessary as a precursor for replication of this model mSanduk
formal analog savings structure, and
community willingness/buy in, It is not yet the best moment to make use of this tool.

# Cost. 
The entire activity cost up to 100,000 USD for the duration of the activity,broken down as below:
12K: community immersion (flights to Abyei & Warawar, ground transportation, security, food); 
16K-Technical support 
60K: intervention heavy lifting (booster packages, M&E, follow-ups with groups)
10k-capacity building trainings are offered.

# People.
The teams involved in this journey included:
Community mobilizer/local partner (implementing partner/CSO to do financial literacy and mobilization for the community) who knows the community to lead community immersion
Interpreter, depending on where you are.
A technical counterpart in the private sector/salesperson to spell out the benefits of the platform Software developer who has soft skills and understands the community.
Team of researchers to reveal insights (volunteers)
Data analyst (volunteer)
Technical Support

# Context:

The Analog to Digital Experiment was launched to explore innovative ways of addressing the socio-economic challenges faced by cross-border traders and the local community. And the theory of change is that through the digitalization of the Sanduk, the groups would gain a digital financial profile that would allow them to better solicit loans from financial service providers. The digital sanduk also provides a safer means for the safekeeping of the communally pooled funds.
Gain a digital financial profile. Enables access to emergency funds that the community can use for social needs, such as paying school fees and medical bills
The initial focus was to build on the women's financial inclusion toolkit, but then we also incorporated and tested the concept with cross-border traders through the ABC cross-border innovation challenge funds. At the South Sudan/Sudan border, the crossborder traders often had to send money to Khartoum through Cairo for the purchase of their goods from Sudan, which took them a lot of time to get their goods delivered. This same group also had their own sanduk saving group, which made it easier for them to be incorporated.
Trying to figure out how to transfer money from Mbok (Sudan) through m-GURUSH (South Sudan) to avoid a long cycle of money flow; however, with the current Sudan situation, this is on hold
Some additional interventions for this project included basic financial literacy training, digital literacy training, and gender and legal services training to help the group learn the basics of business management and the rules and regulations of operating in the markets.
