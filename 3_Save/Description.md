Saving model for financial inclusion in rural community setting involves creating community-based savings group where a pre-defined number of members pool funds for an agreed period of time/cycle, make regular contributions and collectively manage savings. For the success of any community saving initiative; there will be need for a formal structure of governance of some kind where members can elect their leadership to ensure direction and order.

These initiatives often empower individuals economically by providing access to capital for small businesses and addressing financial needs within the community. Impactfulness can be measured by increased financial inclusion, improved livelihoods, and strengthened community resilience. Success depends on effective group management, financial education, and sustainable income-generated activities.
