Documenting a manual group saving process through community immersion

What it does. This process will help to capture the user requirements of an analog community savings model to enable its digitalization.

Value proposition for the government/other partner. By using this process, you will enable any entity that seeks to improve the operational efficiency and safety of analogue group savings groups processes to digitize them and provide the records of financial transactions that banks, and other formal institutions can use to extend financial services.

Additionally, a private sector partner can use this process as a form of R&D, to develop a product from which they can offer financial services to serve left behind rural communities for the sustainability of the product.

mSanduk; A mobile app for community savings adds value because:

It creates digital storage to reduce the risk of loss of community savings due to fire or theft.
Community savings groups can track transactions and savings to build a financial profile for seeking bank loans.
It makes available cash for the community members to borrow during emergencies.
At border/remote areas, making payments is often a struggle, banks are inaccessible, and access to finance and financial services is nonexistent.
To safeguard money from wildfires in rural settings; where most markets are temporary structures which is de-risked by community funds being kept in sanduks;
community saw relief when they realized they could keep money on their phones; able to move freely without worry of money theft/insecurity.
Why and when to use it. A couple of requirements to have in place before taking up on replicating the model and these are the conditions.

Enabling conditions:

Ubiquity of mobile money makes it a good tool;
Communities pool savings
Where community savings have formal structuring
Private sector entities provide mobile money services
need to work with private sector so if they see profit, they can continue and won't die to lack of funding; look for private sector partner and see where there's a benefit for them
Known issues and troubleshooting ; the requirements for this tool to be used so that the user knows when not to use it will include.

If there is a lack of;

infrastructure; mobile network access, the tech infrastructure is necessary as a precursor for replication of this model mSanduk
formal analog savings structure, and
community willingness/buy in, It is not yet the best moment to make use of this tool.
Context.

Sanduks are common group savings practice in S. Sudan and the Sudan, e.g. it comes in forms of commodity sanduks (farmers pooling their products such as; sorghum, beans, and ground nuts etc.) or cash sanduks
The idea was built out of a joint experiment with UKRI (United Kingdom Research and Innovation) and the South Sudan Accelerator Lab to economically empower a group of 400 PLHIV and their caregivers' through the mGurush mobile wallet service.
Borderland communities in rural settings often lack access to formal banking services due to the remoteness of the locations. These groups often conduct cross border trade but lack access to finance to support and grow their businesses. To fill these gaps the: -
Businesspeople often take money home and save it in boxes (Sanduks). They also keep business finances in commodities such as stocks. These business assets are often vulnerable given their nature to threats such as fire, theft of loss. To mitigate against these risks businesses often form small sanduk groups where money or commodities are pooled together by members in a lifecycle of up to 6 months; this enables the sanduks to either grow their business or utilise the funds/commodities for social needs (school fees, medical fees, etc.);
The theory of change for this experiment is through the digitalization of the Sanduk, the groups would gain a digital financial profile that allows them to better solicit for loans from financial service providers. The digital sanduk also provides a safer means for the safe keeping of the communally pooled funds.
Gain a digital financial profile. Enables access to emergency funds that the community can use for social needs; pay school fees/medical bills
The initial focus was to build on the women financial inclusion toolkit; but then we also incorporated and tested the concept with cross border traders through the ABC crossborder innovation challenge funds. At the South Sudan/Sudan border, the crossborder traders often had to send money to Khartoum through Cairo for the purchase of their goods from Sudan which took them lot of time to get their goods delivered; This same group also had their own sanduk saving group which made it easier for them to be incorporated.
Trying to figure out how to transfer money from Mbok (Sudan) through m-GURUSH (South Sudan) to avoid a long cycle of money flow, however, with the current Sudan situation this is on hold
Some additional intervention for this project included; basic financial literacy training, digital literacy training and gender and legal services training to help the group learn basics of business management, and the rules/regulation of operating in the markets.
Cost. The entire activity costed upto 100000 USD for the entire duration of the activity. 12K - community immersion (flights to Abiye & Warawar, ground transportation, security, food); 16K- Technical support 60K â€“ intervention heavy lifting (booster packages, M&E, follow ups with groups)

15- trainings offered

He is a practiced Engineer and has over 5 years of experience working in telecoms with Nokia across Western Europe in Research & Development and Technical Account Management.

At UNDP one of the notable projects Eng. Tong has project led was a pilot scheme to digitalise the traditional Sanduk savings scheme and migrate the analog process onto the M-Gurush platform. The success of this joint pilot with M-Gurush led to the development of a digital Sanduk called mSanduk being launched nationwide on their platform and being made available as a value-added service to their 1.7 million customer base.

In addition, Eng. Tong in his capacity as the UNDP Digital Advocate works to identify and realize opportunities for digital project design and delivery in UNDP to be able to support the developmental aspirations of our lead partner the Government of South Sudan."

Resources. A list of the resources documented in the factsheet. There can be more than one resource, each one presenting the same content in different forms: for example, a concept note and a slide deck of the same project, or the syllabus for a course and the link to a blog post explaining the logic behind the course. Resources can be either files attached to the toolkit or links to external web resources.
