**What it does.** The takeup of digital payment services are hindered by persisting digital divides. Even people who own computing devices and have access to the Internet are often reluctant to use them to make payment, as they do not feel confident enough and fear making mistakes, possibly paying more than they should. The _Red Con Vos_ ("Network With You") is a network of neighborhood stores, whose owners and managers own the necessary equipment for online payments and have been trained in how to help their fellow citizens in doing all kind of online administrative processes (not only payments). Residents gain the convenience of accessing digital payments; store owners charge a small fee for each transaction they facilitate, and, perhaps more importantly, benefit from residents visiting their stores more often.

**Value proposition for the government/other partner.** By capacitating proximity businesses to transmit online payment and conduct other online transactions, this intervention contributes to the accessibility of these services to the least digitally included citizens, including rural communities, children, the elderly and those with care duties. Additionally, the businesses themselves stand to gain new customers. The programme is sustainable, as it is financed with the savings that result from citizens not having to travel to distant location to use digital public services.

**Why and when to use it**. This intervention is particularly well suited to rural communities, low-income neighborhoods and to groups affected by digital divides.

**Known issues and troubleshooting**. Explain which are the necessary requirements for this tool to be used so that the user knows when not to use it. _Suggestion: If there is a lack of [requirement 1], [requirement 2], and [requirement 3], it is not yet the best moment to make use of this tool._

**Context**. In 2019, the UNDP Accelerator Lab in Argentina observed that a few owners of neighborhood stores had started offering, as an additional service to their clients, the possibility to carry out digitally some official bureaucratic procedures – including digital payments – in the stores themselves. Many bureaucratic procedures have been digitalized in Argentina, but many residents do not feel comfortable with going through them without help. These residents fall back to travelling physically to the competent government office or bank, where, however, they are facing long waits because, with digitalization, these organizations are divesting from public-facing physical facilities. This behavior was found to be more frequent in women, the elderly, and low-income households. T. With the onset of the COVID-2019 pandemic, this service came to be in higher demand, as mobility was reduced. The Labs is attempting to scale up this idea from individual initiatives to a service with good coverage of the population. A first pilot in Concepción del Uruguay launched in 2021; a second one launched in Fray in 2022. The two municipalities have different geographic and demographic characteristic, allowing to test the idea in different contexts. These two pilots show Red Con Vos to be financially sustainable, while saving travel time and distance for residents, supporting local commerce, and offering a partial solution to digital exclusion.

**Cost**. How much does it cost, in USD, to implement this tool? _Suggestion: think about what the partner would spend to implement, not about how much it cost to create it in the first place_. To do

**Time**. How long (in calendar time) did it take to implement this tool? To do

**People**. Describe the team needed to implement. Try to avoid just sharing the hierarchy rank and rather focus on their roles. _Suggestion: number of members of the team and responsibilities._
