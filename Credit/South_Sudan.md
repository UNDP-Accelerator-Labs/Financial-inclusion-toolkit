#### South Sudan 

Documenting a manual group saving process through community immersion

What it does. This process will help to capture the user requirements of an analog community savings model to enable its digitalisation. 

Value proposition for the government/other partner.

By using this process, you will enable any entity that seeks to improve the operational efficiency and safety of analogue group savings groups processes to digitize them and provide the records of financial transactions that banks and other formal institutions can use to extend financial services.
