# Factsheet

## A toolkit to embed innovation methods into the civil service (Namibia)

**What it does.** It provides a collection of resources and methods for service design, with a view to their application in a public sector innovation context. Methods include stakeholder mapping, personas, positive deviance; collective intelligence, behavioral insights. Contains various canvases to make applying the methods more intuitive.

**Value proposition for the government or other partner.** By providing a curated collection of resources and methods, we will make innovation in public service less daunting.

**Why and when to use it**. This is an entry-level resource, good for civil servants who are getting to know modern methods for service design.

**Known issues and troubleshooting.** Getting the senior government leaders to understand the importance of collaboration before introducing the tools and methods is half the battle won. It is also important to have a civil service "Champion" at a high level to continue to vouch for the unusual (participatory) and human centered approaches across the government. Finally, ownership of the process from the side of the technical implementers from the civil service is key to ensure that there is continuity in the process.

**Context**. The Public Service Innovation Policy was launched by the Namibian Prime Minister in 2020. The Lab understands that the development and write up of the policy was outsourced to a consultant, and as a result, it is assumed that the implementers and custodians of the policy, (The Public Service Innovation and Reform Unit under the Office of the Prime Minister) do not necessarily have the knowhow to implement the policy, let alone use the basic tools of service and social innovation. The Lab saw the opportunity to introduce an offer to the Office of the Prime Minister by offering 5 Innovation Bootcamps to introduce the tools and methods. The process involved co-creating and designing a fit for purpose "Toolkit" which would be co-delivered through the bootcamps to 350 innovation champions across the public sector.

**Cost to implement** (in USD). From the Accelerator Lab, a budget of U$D20 000 was set aside. The government (Office of the Prime Minister) ran the last Bootcamp which amounted to U$D3500.

**Time** (in calendar time): 15 months

**People** : 3 from the Accelerator Lab and 3 from the Office of the Prime Minister.

**Focal point**. Yrika Maritz

**Country and year**. Namibia 2021

**Resources**. Toolkit; slide deck to introduce the toolkit in bootcamp form.
