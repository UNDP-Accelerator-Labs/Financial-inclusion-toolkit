# Using digital data collection tools to support public servants in match-making informal traders' needs with the right support package. 

The UNDP Cabo Verde Accelerator Labs team created a digital data collection and a corresponding database that allows ProEmpresa staff (public entity of support and business promotion)to match informal market traders's needs with the fitting support package, which traders have not been able to access and exploit fully. 

**What it does:** The experiment was to evaluate the effect of streamlining the processes/relationship between entities that aim to support entrepreneurs and the entrepreneurial community on those entrepreneur's business health. The different components of the experiment tested how ProEmpresa staff would: 

- complete their “entrepreneur” need finding interviews on location with ease while creating a database that links the needs and analysis of the staff to the corresponding business. 
- have enough buffer time between the interview and the office to analyze findings in a centralized manner and then proceed to curate and allocate the needed support for the project. 
- have a physical presence within the vicinity of the markets where the entrepreneurs are found in order to introduce them to the online tools available while also educating them on functions and features.

The experiment aimed to:

1. **Design:** . A digital platform to support Sucupira Market entrepreneurs, especially the recently formalized public of Sucupira50, supplying curated training that matches their needs, with the aim of using digital tools to be in compliance with Finance and Social Security by feeling mandatory online forms and information.
2. **Monitor** : Sucupira50 was carried by ProEmpresa (public entity of support and business promotion) and the project Jov@mEmprego (a project of the Joint Office UNDP, UNFPA and UNICEF) where a total of 72 women benefited with training in numerous management tools and the formalization of their business.
3. **Experiment with** : Providing a physical location to serve as a reference point that can support small traders from feeling overwhelmed or helpless by the digital platform, as well as the efficiency matchmaking offers and needs through a digital tool. 

**Value proposition:** The Implementation of a data collection tool to analyze the requested support. Sucupira public would streamline the processes/relationship between entities that aim to support entrepreneurs and the entrepreneurial community. This creates and more customized way to provide support. This can come in form of some processes, such as payment of benefits, and capacity building for agents to operate [ SDG 5 and 9 ]

**Why and when to use it:** This tool is most useful when an entity has a support package or offers for small informal vendors or entrepreneurs but services are not being used to full capacity. Especially when it comes to: 

- need finding 
- Database building for analysis
- resource matching 

**Known issues and troubleshooting:** For this tool to work you will require: 
1) Existing catalogue of offers
2) Training of staff and providing a physical location to be a "go to" troubleshooting center within the vicinity of the entrepreneurs.


**Context:** The digital data collection and database is part of ProEmpresa tools to act in Sucupira, the largest informal market in Cabo Verde with thousands of informal market traders. In 2020 the project Sucupira50 was carried out by ProEmpresa (a public entity of support and business promotion) and the project Jov@mEmprego (a project of the Joint Office UNDP, UNFPA, and UNICEF) where a total of 72 women benefited from training in numerous management tools and the formalization of their business. The project was successfully completed, accompanied by an evaluation where recommendations were made to cement the results. This digital platform was built to support Sucupira Market entrepreneurs, especially the recently formalized public of Sucupira50, adding special training to them, to use digital tools to be in compliance with Finance and Social Security by feeling mandatory online forms and information. 

**Cost:** The Accelerator Lab funded this effort with a 15.000 USD investment. This can be broken down between 5.000 USD for Improving customer service at the Desk and in the Field - Sucupira Market and 10.000 USD to produce the Attendance Registration Module.
