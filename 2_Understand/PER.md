# A course to build trust in digital technology applied to the needs of market vendors


**What it does.** 

This digitalization journey will help build trust in technology and digital literacy allowing women entrepreneurs to access and benefit from financial inclusion related technologies.

**Value proposition for the government/other partner.** 
Suggestion: By having a [title of the tool], you will enable [the partner] to achieve [something of value and align with UNDP's_ [_signature solutions_](https://www.undp.org/sites/g/files/zskgke326/files/migration/gh/ec896cafde73c2a1c1c2f66c3c3b9312b3ef19593e8ad50ccd0cb8ae621c7303.pdf) _and the_ [_SDGs_](https://sdgs.un.org/goals)_]_.

**Why and when to use it**. Give detail about the "right" environment for this tool to be effectively used. _Suggestion: This tool is most useful when [situation 1], [situation 2], and [situation 3]_.

**Known issues and troubleshooting**. 

Women are the experts and they know better: Digitalization is not about handing out smartphones or laptops. It clearly involves building trust and confidence in those that teach them about apps and websites. However, when it comes to women who trying to catch up with the digital natives around them, it also depends on trusting themselves enough to be aware and confident in their own expertise about their businesses, the tools that they need, and the pace of their digitalization journey.

Digitalization is not a fully digital process: Sounds counterintuitive, but (at least in the early stages) digitalization is a face-to-face process. Has anyone tried to show their mom/dad/grandma/auntie how to do something on their phone by explaining it to them on a voice message? EXACTLY.

...Nor it is an individual process: Because of its offline beginnings, digitalization is not an individual process either. We need to involve communities and families who support any UNDP initiative with their time and dedication to closing the digital gap. UNDP can't go at it alone, even more so because digitalization can change social dynamics and is a seismic shift for the whole community. This brings us to our third learning...

Digitalization can be the starting point for many other processes: For example, digitalization can become a gateway for economic empowerment and formalization of women-owned businesses as they gain grow and gain productivity. Being a digital leader (in Peru we call them "Innova ambassadors") can also have positive externalities, as women discover that they can take leadership positions within their organizations. After all, they have improved their lives through their own effort, why wouldn't they take on a larger challenge?

**Context**.

This tool emerged from the "Innovate your Market" initiative in Peru, a collaborative effort led by the UNDP Peru Accelerator Lab. Innovate your Market was born in early 2021 as an initiative to respond to the direct effects of COVID-19 in the traditional markets in Lima, Peru. In Peru, there are more 2,600 mercados, where more than 50% are located in Lima, a city of 10 million people. The pandemic showcased the disadvantages that traditional neighborhood markets were already experiencing even before the first case of COVID was reported in the country. The dependency on face-to-face interactions, the excessive usage of cash, and the lack of risk management tools were just a few of the critical factors that conducted to the lowest attendance rates of traditional markets in years (despite the fact that before COVID 70% of Peruvians bought their weekly goods in a traditional market).

In this context, Innovate your Market bet on digitalization as a tool for development. But before applying the business as usual of just showcasing digital tools that could fit the mercados context, we centered the attention on why mercados lacked incentives of using technology before COVID-19:

- There were non or few essential infrastructure requirements like data and wifi
- There were few incentives from customers to use digital tools such as digital wallets
- And most importantly, they did not trust digital tools, especially the ones involving money transactions **Cost**. How much does it cost, in USD, to implement this tool? _Suggestion: think about what the partner would spend to implement, not about how much it cost to create it in the first place_.

**People**. 

**Focal point**. [Ximena Gonzalez](/Financial-inclusion-toolkit/contributors/Ximena-Gonzalez.html), [Mariana Olcese](/Financial-inclusion-toolkit/contributors/Mariana-Olcese.html),  

**Country, year, and language**. Peru and El Salvador 2021, 2022, 2023. English and Spanish.

**Resources**. A list of the resources documented in the factsheet. There can be more than one resource, each one presenting the same content in different forms: for example, a concept note and a slide deck of the same project, or the syllabus for a course and the link to a blog post explaining the logic behind the course. Resources can be either files attached to the toolkit or links to external web resources.
