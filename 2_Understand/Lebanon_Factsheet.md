# Financial bookkeeping micro courses to boost women entrepreneurs business confidence

The UNDP Mauritius and Seychelles Accelerator Lab, in partnership with the University of Mauritius and other local stakeholders, including the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family Welfare, the National Women Entrepreneur Council, and Small and Medium Enterprise Mauritius (SME Mauritius), conducted an experiment with 30 women entrepreneurs from the Republic of Mauritius.

**What it does:** The experiment was to evaluate the effect of women's financial book-keeping efficacy building on the confidence of women entrepreneurs and inturn business performance. The different transferrable components would be; 
-	The call for participation component used to recruit a defined target profile online through online media funnels removing tens of middlemen contractors and substantial cost, while also identifying which behavioural driver or barrier was the most resonant among
-	The chunking of financial book-keeping knowledge into micro “just in time” learning resources modeled on a visible excel sheet and by a regional Arab speaking woman entrepreneur showed substantial engagement.
-	The incentive of a free pre-programmed excel sheet (the same one used in the corse content) as a reward for course completors was a converting value offer. This excel would be used to practice their learning directly on their businesses, we attribute this incentive framing to the 21% course completion rate. ( 5% more than that of a similar coursera course)

The experiment aimed to:

1. **Design:** An email course spanning 7 days, including videos in the local language covering the basics of book-keeping, showcased on a visible excel tool, and modeled by a regional woman entrepreneur. This modality was tested to determine if it could efficiently enhance efficacy of book-keeping for the pilot group of women entrepreneurs participating in the experiment.
2. **Monitor** : The perceived knowledge and understanding in the of the covered book-keeping practices, were tested throught out the email course with interactive questions at the end of each email. 
3. **Experiment with** : Email medium as an interactive learning platform that works with women's expressed needs of convenience and their pain points around mobiluty required for participating in trainings. More specifically, the experiment aimed to evaluate the impact of redesigning financial litracy education from a localized women-centered perspective and how this can prompt self efficacy and in turn confidence in business decisions.

**Value proposition:** By using the different components of the “Micro email course” you will enable any partner to drastically improve the quality and relevance of recruits to women economic empowerment programs and can also ensure wide scale education of core financial literacy components in a regional localized manner in order to increase the number of women in business but also increase the inclusion of women in financial decision making and investment on the long run. Using digital learning solutions to deliver on 2 of UNDP’s signature solutions by tackling inequality of opportunities (Poverty & inequality ss) while also being deliberate about the profile of audience to grow and impact being women with digital access (Gender equality ss).

**Why and when to use it:** This tool is most useful when a program is aiming to recruit and identify a specific demographic entrepreneur profile while also understanding their localized pain points and learning gaps when it comes to financial literacy and its relationship to delaying in achieving their business goals and financial stability or growth. 
This tool is also useful when different skills that have systematically been taught through a masculine or generic lens excluding women can become more resonant to women and speak more to their needs, constraints, and preferred channels of communication .

**Known issues and troubleshooting:** For this tool to work you will require: 
1) Some contact list or a media outlet that can broadcast the recruitment call.
2) Any email sending platform.
3) A local or regional success that can be the “modeling agent” of the micro learning content.

**Context:** In 2021, the Lebanon CO’s Accelerator Lab and Women’s Economic Empowerment project participated in a RBAS innovation initiative (with nine other Country Offices in the Arab States) on “Paving the Path to Successful Youth Entrepreneurship through Behavioural Insights”. Supported by the Behavioural Insights Team of consultants, the project was designed to learn about the interplay between structural and behavioral barriers to entrepreneurship and to test behavioral approaches to enhance UNDP’s entrepreneurship programming.
The Lebanon CO, alongside the partner NGO Berytech, has been learning about the effectiveness of simple financial bookkeeping tools in enhancing the confidence of women entrepreneurs in their financial planning skills. The Regional Innovation team supported the project pilot technically and financially in order to scale the learnings from the behavioural research into a customisable micro-email course that could also be tested by other Country Offices.
The work was showcased at:  UN Behavioural Science Week 2022 (6-10 June). 

**Cost:** The Accelerator Lab secured partnerships successfully. This initiative was funded by the Government of Canada as part of its Women economic empowerment efforts in Lebanon and by the RBAS innovation unit. The UNDP Accelerator Lab co-designed the content with the regional leading entrepreneur Eman Bushnaq (Account for around 8,000 USD for commissioned content and customised book-keeping tool IP). The team was also able to secure a small sum of 5,000 USD to recruit niche demographic through online media. What remains is a minimal sum that represents the subscription fee to an email automation platform such as constant contacts, or MailChimp, or other. 

**People:** Funded and co-designed by the UNDP Accelerator Lab Lebanon team, The UNDP Women Economic empowerment project, the gender unit, in collaboration with the external consultants in online media, and the entrepreneur commissioned to create content and tool.
